Navigating the uncharted waters of [PostgreSQL](https://postgresql.org)
within [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) using open-source technologies,
I bring a wealth of expertise to the table as a KubeCon speaker,
[Data on Kubernetes Community Ambassador](https://dok.community/ambassadors/),
maintainer of the [CloudNativePG](https://cloudnative-pg.io) Operator,
and author of Postgres books.
My passions are DevOps, High Availability, Disaster Recovery, Very Large
Databases (VLDB) and data warehousing with PostgreSQL.
I'm VP, Chief Architect of Kubernetes at [EDB](https://enterprisedb.com).
Opinions are my own.

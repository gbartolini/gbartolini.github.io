Ciao! I'm Gabriele, an open-source programmer and entrepreneur boasting a
Statistics degree from the University of Florence, specializing in data mining
and data warehousing.
My journey in the tech realm has been marked by significant contributions to
the [PostgreSQL](https://postgresql.org) ecosystem since the early 2000s.

Over the years, I've played a pivotal role in shaping lean and DevOps culture
at 2ndQuadrant, and presently, I am steering the strategic direction of
Kubernetes initiatives at [EDB](https://enterprisedb.com) as Vice President
and Chief Architect of Kubernetes.

As a co-founder of [CloudNativePG](https://cloudnative-pg.io) and
[Barman](https://pgbarman.org) open-source projects, I am deeply committed to
advancing technology and fostering collaborative development. Join me on this
exciting journey at the intersection of innovation and open-source excellence!
